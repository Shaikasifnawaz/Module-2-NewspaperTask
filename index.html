                <p>Prabshsukhan Singh Gill may have won the golden glove in the Indian Super League (ISL) on Sunday but Gurpreet Singh Sandhu is likely to start in goal when India square off against Bahrain on Wednesday. The goalkeeper’s position is extremely
                    important and for such an important game, we should stick to our goalkeeper No. 1. He has been training with us for 10-11 days and we are trying to bring him back to his best. I am not in favour of change in this position,” said India
                    head coach Igor Stimac on Tuesday. </p>
                <p>Sandhu had an ordinary ISL, managing three clean sheets in 15 games for Bengaluru FC; Gill had seven in 20 in his breakout season with Kerala Blasters. The squad travelled separately as seven players were, “still in Mumbai waiting for
                    visas which we had applied nearly two months ago,” said Stimac at a virtual media conference from Bahrain. Later on Tuesday, All India Football Federation (AIFF) officials said all of them have been issued visas but, because of limited
                    flights, won’t reach Bahrain before Wednesday.</p>
                <p>Goalkeeper Amrinder Singh, left-back Akash Mishra, central defender Chinglensana Singh, midfielders Anirudh Thapa, Brandon Williams, Aniket Jadhav and Bipin Singh were those stranded in Mumbai, said Stimac. Since Singh would have to be
                    released for Mumbai City FC’s Champions League preparations after the game against Bahrain, Stimac has decided not to call him, a source in the team said from Bahrain. The India squad will have 24 players, the source said. Apart from
                    Gill, Stimac has chosen six new players for the friendlies. They are: full back Roshan Singh, who won the ISL’s Emerging Player of the Year, central defenders Ruivah Hormipam and Anwar Ali, midfielders Jadhav and Danish Farooq, and
                    forward VP Suhair. Mumbai City FC defender Rahul Bheke will be released after the game against Bahrain. The last time India played Bahrain was in the 2019 Asian Cup. Needing a draw to qualify for the round of 16, India lost 0-1 through
                    Jamal Rashid’s penalty-kick in second-half stoppage time. “For every Indian that was heartbreaking,” said central defender Sandesh Jhingan who was also part of the interaction. “But that’s football. But honestly, we didn’t do enough.
                    I know I could have done better.” India sat too deep in that game and Jhingan said, “sometimes that works and sometimes it does not.” That is not the approach India will take, said Stimac. “I want to see a positive attitude, see the
                    team use the middle and high press and take certain risks to try and use then ball more.” Wednesday’s game is not about trying to even scores but getting better, said Jhingan.</p>

    <blockquote>Kerala Blasters began the match pressing high and came excruciatingly close to scoring in the 39th minute when Alvaro Vazquez’s shot from the edge of the box hit the outside of the goalpost — an entity that denied KBFC, goals not once but thrice in
        the match. Hyderabad FC, which has scored the most number of goals this season, looked very unlike its reputation launching just two shots in the first half — with its final third zonally marked well by the trio of Marko Leskovic, Hormipam Ruivah
        and Jeakson Singh. After a dominant first-half display by Blasters, its local boy Rahul KP, who received a resounding welcome ever since coming on to warm up, scored the opening goal in the 68th minute. The Thrissur-born player hit a phenomenal
        strike from outside the box, which despite a touch by HFC goalkeeper Laxmikant Kattimani, sneaked into the net, leading to one section of the fans erupting, as they whistled, danced and illuminated the stadium with their mobile flashlights..</blockquote>

            <p>With Marko Leskovic’s header after a touch by Jeakson Singh hitting the bar in the 102nd minute and Leskovic denying Ogbeche a certain goal eight minutes later, the stage was well-set for the penalty shootout – KBFC’s second one in an ISL
                final.

            <p>Kerala’s two key strikers Alvaro Vazquez and Jose Pereyra Diaz were subbed off by Ivan Vukomanovic, which returned to haunt him as his side missed three of its four penalties, with Ayush Adhikari the only player to find the back of the net.
                The last time Hyderabad FC played in front of its fans, the side finished at the bottom of the table. When fans returned, HFC gave them something they yearned for – football, goals, trophies and above all, happiness.</p>

            <p>kerala Blasters goalkeeper Prabhsukhan Singh Gill is set to win the Golden Glove this season, currently sitting on top of the list for clean sheets, and with his closest competitor Amrinder Singh of ATK Mohun Bagan out of the tournament. He
                has seven clean sheets in 19 matches until the final, while Amrinder could have gone level with him, if he would have gone to the final of the Indian Super League this season.</p>
